[![Laravel Forge Site Deployment Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforge.laravel.com%2Fsite-badges%2F728e84e8-8c12-440b-8817-857a951dbf2c&style=plastic)](https://forge.laravel.com)

## Installation

### Using laravel sail over Orbstack

A full configuration was made for Centerstage application work out of the box using Orbstack, with both Core and Centerstage applications running over Orbstack there are minimal settings to change
in order to make them work together.

#### Requirements

- Orbstack must be installed `brew install orbstack`
-

#### Configuration

1. Core Project
    1. Add or update the following environment variables:
       ```dotenv
       SERVICE_NAME=airlst-core
       COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=airlst-core
       CENTERSTAGE_BASE_URL=http://app.airlst-centerstage.orb.local
       SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=false
       ```
    2. Set network property in Core project's `docker-compose.yml`
        ```yaml
        networks:
          sail:
            driver: bridge
            ipam:
              driver: default
              config:
               - subnet: 192.168.158.0/24
       ```
       > This is a temporary local solution until we agree a way to handle routing with Core Team
    3. Now you are good to run `sail up -d`
2. Centerstage Project
    1. Copy the `.env.orbstack.example` content into `.env` file.
    2. Make sure the following env variables has the same value in Centerstage and Core respectively:
        1. `WEBHOOK_CLIENT_SECRET` in Centerstage must be the same as `CENTERSTAGE_OUTGOING_WEBHOOKS_SECRET` in Core.
        2. `CENTERSTAGE_API_REQUEST_SECRET` in Centerstage must be the as `CENTERSTAGE_BACKEND_REQUEST_SECRET` in Core

#### Commands

For centerstage run the following installation commands

```shell
composer install
sail up -d
sail npm install && sail npm run prod 
sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

For Core Project, please follow instructions in airlst-core repository.

####      

At this point application should be running on `http://laravel.test.airlst-core.orb.local/`

#### Troubleshooting

##### Error response from daemon: Address already in use

Change `IP_ADDRESS` variable to use a different address between `192.168.158.1` and `192.168.158.254` which corresponds to the subnet mask which is set.
